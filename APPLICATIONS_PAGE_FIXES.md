# 📄 Applications Page Fixes & Verification

## 🎯 Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ **Fixed Duplicate Button Errors**
**Problem**: Multiple buttons with identical text causing `StreamlitDuplicateElementId` errors
**Solution**: Added unique `key` parameters to all buttons

- `🔄 Initialize/Upgrade Database` → Added key: `admin_tools_init_db`
- `📊 Recalculate Statistics` → Added key: `admin_tools_recalc_stats`
- `🗑️ Clear All Expired Sessions` → Added key: `admin_tools_clear_all_sessions`
- `🔄 Refresh Database Connection` → Added key: `settings_refresh_db`

- `🗑️ Clean Low Scores` (sidebar) → Added key: `sidebar_clean_low_scores`
- Export buttons → Added keys: `apps_export_cover_letters`, `apps_export_interview_prep`, `apps_export_summary`

### 2. ✅ **Enhanced Applications Page User Isolation**

#### **For Regular Users:**
- ✅ Can only access their user-specific file: `./data/users/{user_id}/cover_letters.md`
- ✅ View mode is fixed to "My Applications" (no toggle available)
- ✅ Double-filtered to ensure only their applications are shown
- ✅ No access to other users' data

#### **For Admin Users:**
- ✅ Toggle between "My Applications" and "All Applications"
- ✅ "My Applications" shows only admin's own applications (filtered by admin's user_id)
- ✅ "All Applications" loads global file and shows all users' applications
- ✅ User filter dropdown available in "All Applications" mode
- ✅ High score notifications prominently displayed

## 🧪 **Testing Results**

**Test Script**: `test_apps_page.py`

### User Isolation Logic Tests:
✅ **Regular User Test**: user1 correctly sees only 2 applications (both belong to user1)
✅ **Admin "All Applications"**: Admin sees all 4 applications from all users
✅ **Admin "My Applications"**: Admin sees only 1 application (their own)

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### Application Filtering Logic:
```python
# Filter applications by user if needed
if view_mode == "My Applications":
    if is_admin:
        # Admin viewing their own applications - filter by admin's user_id
        applications = [app for app in applications if app.get('user_id') == user_id]
    else:
        # Regular users - should only see their own applications (already from their file)
        # But double-check to ensure data isolation
        applications = [app for app in applications if app.get('user_id') == user_id]
```

### File Access Logic:
```python
# Check cover letter files
if view_mode == "My Applications":
    # User-specific file
    cover_letter_file = f"./data/users/{user_id}/cover_letters.md"
    if not os.path.exists(cover_letter_file):
        st.info("No applications generated yet. Process some jobs first!")
        return
else:
    # Global file for admin
    cover_letter_file = "./data/cover_letter.md"
    if not os.path.exists(cover_letter_file):
        st.info("No applications found in the system.")
        return
```
