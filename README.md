## Tech Stack

### **Using Langgraph** 

- For building agentic workflows, there are multiple popular frameworks available, such as CrewAI, AutoGen, or Agency Swarm. However, most of them grant full autonomy to the agents while accomplishing tasks and do not provide control over the working process of the agents.

- With Langgraph, you gain that control. You can decide when each agent or tool needs to be called, and you can add custom feedback based on the agent's output, which aids in self-improvement. Essentially, Langgraph is the best choice when you know exactly the process flow of your application, whereas other frameworks allow agents to choose the process.

- Langgraph also enables you to use an LLM only when necessary. For example, in this application, we need to scrape jobs from Upwork, which does not require an LLM call; a simple node tool suffices. In other frameworks, you would need to create an agent that calls the scraping tool through function calling, which helps reduce the application's cost.
