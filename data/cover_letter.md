### Job Description
Title: Build a Flowise‑Powered Image‑to‑Compliance Checker (OpenAI Vision + RAG)
Description: We're a custom apparel printing company that needs to quickly check customer-submitted design images for licensing compliance related to universities and Greek organizations (fraternities and sororities). We need a simple yet robust GUI workflow (using flowiseai.com) that does the following:Image Analysis: Users upload an apparel mock-up image (PNG/JPG). Use OpenAI Vision (gpt-4o-mini) to accurately detect the university or Greek organization's name/logo featured on the apparel.Flowise Dynamic Policy Retrieval (RAG): Use the identified organization from Step 1 to search a vectorized knowledgebase of hundreds of short PDF documents (each 1-5 pages) containing licensing rules specific to universities and Greek organizations. The tool should automatically pull relevant policy snippets based on the image analysis results.Compliance Verification: Clearly display a compliance result (YES/NO), along with detailed notes on what needs to be adjusted for approval if the design does not meet compliance rules.The final tool should have an accessible via an API endpoint (Flowise supports this) for integration into other internal workflows.If you have a better solution for this than Flowise, we are open to it.DEADLINE: within 12-24 hoursThank you!
