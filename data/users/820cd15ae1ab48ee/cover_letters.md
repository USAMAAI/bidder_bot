Job ID: f2492cc4995a7b58

### Job Description
Summary
I’m building an AI-powered tool that scans marketing funnel pages, analyzes conversion elements, and provides actionable recommendations based on best marketing practices. The system should detect missing or weak elements (headlines, CTAs, social proof, urgency triggers) and suggest optimizations using AI-driven insights.

The goal is to create a tool where users enter a URL, and the system scrapes key data, evaluates the page against high-converting templates, and generates a report highlighting improvements.

Scope of Work:
✅ Web Scraping & Data Extraction

Extract headline, CTA, testimonials, urgency indicators, social proof, pricing structure, and other conversion elements from websites.
Preferred tools: Playwright, Scrapy, or similar scraping framework.
Ability to handle JavaScript-heavy pages (e.g., ClickFunnels, Leadpages, WordPress sites).
✅ AI Analysis & Evaluation

Use OpenAI API (GPT-4-turbo) or custom NLP models to classify page elements based on marketing best practices.
Implement sentiment analysis and persuasion framework matching (AIDA, PAS, storytelling techniques).
Compare scraped pages to high-performing funnels and detect missing or misused elements.
✅ User Interface & Report Generation

Create a dashboard where users can enter their URL and view an analysis report.
Display Urgent Fixes (critical conversion problems) and High-Impact Tests (split test recommendations).
Allow account creation & limited free access (1 free insight, more via referral or paid access).
✅ Referral & Monetization System

Implement a viral sharing system where users unlock additional insights by referring others.
Add a paywall system (credits/subscription model) for full access to reports.
Ideal Candidate Skills:
✔️ Experience with web scraping (Playwright, Scrapy, or Selenium)
✔️ AI/NLP expertise (OpenAI API, TensorFlow, or Hugging Face)
✔️ Frontend/backend skills (Bubble.io, Next.js, or Python FastAPI)
✔️ Familiarity with conversion rate optimization (CRO) and marketing frameworks
✔️ API integrations (Google PageSpeed, OpenAI, Stripe for payments)

Bonus Skills (Nice to Have):
⭐ Experience with ClickFunnels, Leadpages, Unbounce, or other funnel platforms
⭐ UX/UI skills for clean dashboard design
⭐ Experience building viral referral systems or gamified user incentives

Project Type & Timeline:
📌 MVP Goal: Build a functional prototype within 4-6 weeks.
📌 Tech Stack (Flexible): Python (FastAPI), React/Next.js, Firebase/PostgreSQL, OpenAI API.
📌 Budget: Open to discussion based on experience.
