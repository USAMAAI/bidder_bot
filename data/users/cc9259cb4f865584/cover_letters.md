‚úÖ AI Analysis & Evaluation

Use OpenAI API (GPT-4-turbo) or custom NLP models to classify page elements based on marketing best practices.
Implement sentiment analysis and persuasion framework matching (AIDA, PAS, storytelling techniques).
Compare scraped pages to high-performing funnels and detect missing or misused elements.
‚úÖ User Interface & Report Generation

Create a dashboard where users can enter their URL and view an analysis report.
Display Urgent Fixes (critical conversion problems) and High-Impact Tests (split test recommendations).
Allow account creation & limited free access (1 free insight, more via referral or paid access).
‚úÖ Referral & Monetization System

Implement a viral sharing system where users unlock additional insights by referring others.
Add a paywall system (credits/subscription model) for full access to reports.
Ideal Candidate Skills:
‚úîÔ∏è Experience with web scraping (Playwright, Scrapy, or Selenium)

Bonus Skills (Nice to Have):
‚≠ê Experience with ClickFunnels, Leadpages, Unbounce, or other funnel platforms
‚≠ê UX/UI skills for clean dashboard design
‚≠ê Experience building viral referral systems or gamified user incentives
