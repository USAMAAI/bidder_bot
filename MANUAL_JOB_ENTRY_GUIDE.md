# Manual Job Entry System Guide

Since the automated Upwork scraping is currently blocked by anti-bot protection, this manual job entry system allows you to add job details manually to continue using the application workflow.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Quick Entry (Fastest)
For rapid job addition with minimal fields:
```bash
python quick_add_job.py
```

### Option 2: Full Interactive Entry
For complete job details with all fields:
```bash
python manual_job_entry.py --interactive
```

### Option 3: Batch Import from Files
For importing multiple jobs at once:
```bash
# From JSON file
python manual_job_entry.py --import-json jobs.json

# From CSV file  
python manual_job_entry.py --import-csv jobs.csv
```

## üìã Available Commands

### Interactive Entry
```bash
python manual_job_entry.py --interactive
python manual_job_entry.py -i
```

    "client_company_profile": "Tech startup focused on automation"
  }
]
```

### CSV Format
Use the headers: `title,description,job_type,experience_level,duration,payment_rate,link,proposal_requirements,client_location,client_joined_date,client_total_spent,client_total_hires,client_company_profile`

## üîÑ Integration with Main Application

Once you've added jobs manually, you can run the main application workflow:

```bash
python main.py
```

The application will:
1. Load your manually entered jobs from the database
2. Score and rank them based on your criteria
3. Generate cover letters and applications
4. Create interview preparation materials

## üí° Tips for Efficient Job Entry

### 1. **Use Quick Entry for Speed**
When you need to add jobs quickly, use `python quick_add_job.py` - it only asks for essential fields.

### 2. **Batch Import for Multiple Jobs**
If you have many jobs to add:
1. Create a CSV or JSON file
2. Copy the example format
3. Fill in your job data
4. Import with `--import-csv` or `--import-json`

### 3. **Copy-Paste Job Descriptions**
You can copy entire job descriptions from Upwork and paste them directly - the system handles formatting.

### 4. **Payment Rate Formatting**
The system automatically adds "$" if missing:
- Enter: `15-25` ‚Üí Stored as: `$15-25`
- Enter: `$1000` ‚Üí Stored as: `$1000`

## üîç Finding Jobs to Add

Since scraping is blocked, you can manually browse Upwork and copy job details:

1. **Go to Upwork** and search for relevant jobs
2. **Copy the job details** (title, description, etc.)
3. **Use the manual entry system** to add them
4. **Run the main application** to process them

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "Job already exists" error
Each job gets a unique ID. If you see this error, the job was already added.

### Database not found
The system automatically creates the database on first run.

### Import errors
Check that your JSON/CSV format matches the examples created by `--create-examples`.

### Encoding issues
All files are handled with UTF-8 encoding to support international characters.

## üîÑ Workflow Integration

After adding jobs manually, the rest of the application works normally:

1. **Add jobs manually** (using this system)
2. **Run scoring** (jobs get scored automatically)  
3. **Generate applications** (cover letters created)
4. **Prepare for interviews** (interview prep generated)

This manual system serves as a replacement for the automated scraping while maintaining full functionality of the job application workflow.

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that all required Python packages are installed
2. Ensure the database file can be created/accessed
3. Verify JSON/CSV file formats against the examples
4. Use `--view-jobs` to confirm jobs were added correctly
